Learning C# 

**Day 1 Progress**

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. Data Types
- Explored basic C# data types: `char`, `int`, `short`, `long`, `uint`, `double`, `float`, `decimal`, and `bool`.
- Practiced variable declaration, initialization, and output using `Console.WriteLine`.

### 2. Lists and Collections
- Created and manipulated `List<string>`.
- Performed operations: adding, removing, sorting, and searching elements.
- Used `foreach` loops for iteration.
- Demonstrated 0-based indexing in lists and arrays.

### 3. LINQ (Language Integrated Query)
- Queried collections using LINQ query and method syntax.
- Filtered, selected, and iterated over data using LINQ.
- Practiced common LINQ operations: `Where`, `Select`, `OrderBy`, `Sum`, etc.

### 4. Pattern Matching
- Used pattern matching with `is`, relational, and type patterns.
- Demonstrated property and constant patterns.
- Applied pattern matching with nullable types.

### 5. IEnumerable vs IQueryable
- Learned the differences between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable`.
- Understood their use cases for in-memory and remote data querying.

### 6. Tuples
- Created and used tuples to group multiple values.
- Explored tuple deconstruction for easy access to individual elements.

### 7. Records
- Defined and used records for immutable data structures.
- Explored record features like value equality and concise syntax.

### 8.Branching and loops
- Implemented `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for conditional logic.
- Used `switch` statements for multi-way branching.
- Utilized `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops for iteration.
- Explored `foreach` loops for collections and arrays.

### 9.String Manipulation
- Practiced string operations: concatenation, interpolation, and formatting.
- Explored string methods like `Substring`, `IndexOf`, and `Replace`.

### 10. String Matching
- Used `StartsWith`, `EndsWith`, and `Contains` for string matching.

### 11.OOPS(Object-Oriented Programming)
- Learned about classes, objects, and encapsulation.
- Learned Constructors.
- Explored inheritance and polymorphism.
